Identifying or locating the Forest-Dependent Communities has been the interest of many reseachers. 
However, they have been struggle on how to appropriately choose the indicators and criteria to best identify them.

This App is designed to provide the flexibility for the researchers to play with the data that we directly pull from the US Census API's. 
Users can adjust the criteria regarding to the Spatial relationship, Economic dependency and Cultural Connection. 

After the forest-dependent communities are identified, we can monitor their macro-economic conditions i.e. number of population, income, unemployment, etc.

Users can download the data into their own local computer.
